# Auction-System-Java-SQL-Database---java-project
Created a command-line Java application for an auction system where users can list items for sale, place bids, and manage transactions with authentication and login features.  Stored all data in a SQL database, allowing users to view bid histories, current highest bids, and finalize transactions,  with all actions tracked and recorded.
